[![Powered by OrcaRouter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered_by-OrcaRouter-2563eb)](https://www.orcarouter.ai/ref/ref_b7dd35655fa712a6b8b0)

PR review bot powered by AI coding agents running inside hardened Bubblewrap sandboxes. Mention `@samik-bot` on a pull request and it runs an agentic review against the PR diff, posting a summary comment with a Mermaid sequence diagram followed by inline diff findings.

Preconfigured for [OrcaRouter](https://www.orcarouter.ai) (`orcarouter/auto`) with dual-engine support:
- [OpenCode 2](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs) (`opencode2`, default)
- [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) (`pi`, lightweight Node agent)

> **Engines & Gateways.** Reviews run under Bubblewrap isolation with read-only repository access. Models use `provider/model` identifiers. `orcarouter/…` models route through [OrcaRouter](https://www.orcarouter.ai) (OpenAI-compatible gateway at `https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1`). `opencode/…` models route through OpenCode Zen. Keys are encrypted at rest in SQLite and injected only into the sandboxed agent's isolated credential store.

## How it works

1. GitHub webhook `issue_comment.created` → verify HMAC → body mentions `@<BOT_USERNAME>` →
   commenter must have registered in the dashboard → their immutable numeric GitHub user ID must
   be in `ADMIN_GITHUB_IDS` or `REVIEWER_GITHUB_IDS`, and the target installation and repository
   IDs must both be allowlisted → enqueue (one active review per PR; reacts 👀). Unregistered
   commenters receive a registration nudge; registered but unauthorized commenters receive an
   access nudge.
2. Worker: pick the eligible pooled key with the fewest recorded requests today (skipping
   cooling-down/disabled keys)
   → shallow-clone the PR head → fetch the diff via the GitHub API → write an isolated engine
   config and credential store (the key exists only inside the sandbox) in a temp XDG/config dir →
   run the configured reviewer engine in a Bubblewrap sandbox with the review prompt (the agent
   reads repository files itself), selected model, isolated output, and a hard timeout. With
   `REVIEW_ENGINE=pi` the runner executes `pi --print` with a read-only tool allowlist
   (`read,grep,find,ls`), all project-local discovery disabled, no session persistence, and the
   pooled key written to pi's isolated `auth.json` as the credential of the model's gateway
   provider (built-in `opencode` for Zen, a per-run custom provider for `orcarouter/…`).
3. Parse the agent's final message: last fenced JSON block `{summary, sequence_diagram, findings:[{path,
   line, side, severity, body}]}` (tolerant — plain text gets a safe fallback diagram) → map findings
   to diff lines via the PR file list (skip findings outside the diff) → post the summary with its
   Mermaid diagram first, then inline review comments → react 🚀 on success, or react 👎 and record a
   failure cause on terminal failure → record per-key usage. A
   402/429/quota failure cools that key for `ZEN_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` and may retry once with another
   eligible, authorized key.

Terminal failures mark the review `failed` in the dashboard with an operator-safe cause (for example
`opencode_execution`, `sandbox_unavailable`, `github_http_404`) so the PR's review slot is released
and the requester can mention the bot again. The service log gains the cause plus, for agent and
sandbox failures, a bounded sanitized excerpt of the reviewer's stderr; set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for
engine-internal detail. Shutdown interruptions are not failures: those rows are requeued durably by
the next startup.

## Local setup

Install [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) first. The repository pins Go and Bun in `mise.toml`; do not
rely on whichever versions happen to be globally installed. Install the current supported OpenCode
2 beta CLI separately, package it with its dependencies in a trusted runtime directory, and install
Bubblewrap on the Linux host before attempting a live review. The default `OPENCODE_BIN=opencode2`
is resolved as `$OPENCODE_RUNTIME_DIR/bin/opencode2`, not from an arbitrary application `PATH`.
Follow the [OpenCode 2 beta installation guide](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs) instead of assuming a
V1 `opencode` installation or an unsupported beta packaging method.

`make setup` installs the repository-pinned Go/Bun toolchain and application dependencies only; it
intentionally does not install the external OpenCode beta CLI, Bubblewrap, or any credentials. After
staging `opencode2`, confirm the non-interactive automation entry point before configuring the
service:

```bash
make setup
OPENCODE_BIN=/opt/opencode-runtime/bin/opencode2 mise exec -- make opencode-check
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with the required GitHub, ID allowlist, sandbox, session, and model values.
mise exec -- make run-local
```

`opencode-check` runs `opencode2 --version` and `opencode2 run --help`; it does not call a model,
validate the Bubblewrap sandbox, or need a gateway API key. `make run-local` loads `.env` only for a
local POSIX-shell run. The binary itself reads process environment variables and never parses `.env`;
production must inject values through its secret manager. The web UI is at `$PUBLIC_URL` (`/`
landing, `/dashboard` reviews, `/admin/keys`, `/admin/settings`). Health check: `GET /healthz` →
`{"status":"ok"}`.

### Selecting the pi reviewer engine

Set `REVIEW_ENGINE=pi` (plus `PI_RUNTIME_DIR`, and optionally `PI_BIN`) to run
[pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) instead of `opencode2`. The OpenCode configuration
above stays valid and untouched — the two engines are configured, staged, and validated separately,
so you can switch back with one env var. Both engines use the same pooled gateway keys and the same
`ZEN_DEFAULT_MODEL` / dashboard model setting in `provider/model` form; for free models pick a Zen
`-free` model ID (for example `opencode/big-pickle`).

Stage a pi runtime directory the same way as the OpenCode runtime: an absolute trusted directory
(mounted read-only, no symlinked/group-writable/world-writable entries) containing `bin/pi` and
its dependencies. pi is a Node CLI, so the sandbox tree must also contain the `node` executable —
the sandbox has no host `/usr/bin/env`, so `bin/pi` must be a launcher with an absolute shebang
such as `#!/opt/pi-runtime/bin/sh`. The staged tree must keep the npm package layout (a
`package.json` above `dist/`), because pi resolves its built-in themes and templates relative to
the package root. Example staging from an npm install:

```bash
npm pack @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent        # then unpack into /opt/pi-runtime/lib/pi-coding-agent
cp -r "$SRC/node_modules/@earendil-works/chord" /opt/pi-runtime/lib/pi-coding-agent/node_modules/@earendil-works/
cp "$(command -v node)" /opt/pi-runtime/bin/node    # copy, never symlink
cp "$(command -v bash)" /opt/pi-runtime/bin/sh      # copy, never symlink
cat > /opt/pi-runtime/bin/pi <<'EOF'
#!/opt/pi-runtime/bin/sh
exec /opt/pi-runtime/bin/node /opt/pi-runtime/lib/pi-coding-agent/dist/bundle/cli.js "$@"
EOF
chmod 0755 /opt/pi-runtime/bin/pi
PI_BIN=/opt/pi-runtime/bin/pi mise exec -- make pi-check
```

`pi-check` runs `pi --version` and `pi --help`; the service's startup preflight additionally runs
`pi --list-models <gateway>` inside the same Bubblewrap profile, where `<gateway>` is the provider
prefix of the configured default model (`opencode` for Zen, `orcarouter` for OrcaRouter). This
proves the staged agent
resolves that gateway provider from the isolated credential store without calling
a model.

### OrcaRouter Preconfiguration

`samik-bot` is preconfigured for [OrcaRouter](https://www.orcarouter.ai) out of the box (`ZEN_DEFAULT_MODEL=orcarouter/auto`). The provider configuration ships in `orcarouter.toml`:

```toml
model = "orcarouter/auto"
model_provider = "orcarouter"

[model_providers.orcarouter]
name     = "OrcaRouter"
base_url = "https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
env_key  = "ORCA_KEY"
```

Both reviewer engines support OrcaRouter seamlessly:
- **`opencode2`**: Dynamically receives a custom `orcarouter` provider in its sandbox `opencode.json` (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` at `https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1`) with the pooled key injected via the isolated auth store.
- **`pi`**: Dynamically receives a custom `orcarouter` provider in `models.json` under its isolated sandbox directory (`baseUrl: https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1`, using OpenAI-compatible chat completions) alongside its auth store.

To route reviews through OrcaRouter, keep the default `ZEN_DEFAULT_MODEL=orcarouter/auto` (or switch model dynamically at `/admin/settings`), and connect or add OrcaRouter API keys.

### OrcaRouter Partner Integration & Connect Flow

The bot integrates with OrcaRouter's partner dashboard at `/admin/partner`:
- **Referral attribution**: Preconfigured with partner referral code `ref_b7dd35655fa712a6b8b0` (override with `ORCAROUTER_REFERRAL_CODE`). New accounts signing up via your link (`https://www.orcarouter.ai/ref/ref_b7dd35655fa712a6b8b0`) are credited automatically.
- **Connect with OrcaRouter**: Administrators can click the drop-in **Connect with OrcaRouter** button at `/admin/partner`. The server mints a secure PKCE challenge (`/orca/connect-url`), redirects to consent, and exchanges the authorization code server-side (`/auth/orca/callback`). The API key never touches the browser and is encrypted straight into SQLite.

Build and verify the frontend plus single binary:

```bash
mise exec -- make check
mise exec -- make build
```

The binary is written to `bin/samik-bot`. `web/dist` is the Vite production build embedded into
the binary (`web/embed.go`, SPA fallback in `internal/server`). Go builds omit local source paths and
VCS checkout state. For frontend development, keep `mise exec -- make run-local` running in one
terminal, then run `mise exec -- make web-dev` in a second terminal; Vite listens on `:5173` and
proxies `/api`, `/auth`, `/healthz`, and `/webhooks` to the local Go server on `:8080`.

## GitHub App setup (click-by-click)

You need **two** GitHub-side registrations: a GitHub App (webhooks and review comments) and a
GitHub OAuth App (dashboard login). They are separate registrations.

### 1. Create the GitHub App

1. GitHub → Settings (your org/user) → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App.
2. Name: `samik-bot` (must be globally unique; add a suffix if taken).
3. Homepage URL: your `PUBLIC_URL` (e.g. `https://bot.example.com`).
4. Webhook URL: `https://<host>/webhooks/github`. Webhook secret: generate
   (`openssl rand -hex 32`) and save as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
5. Repository permissions: `Contents: read`, `Pull requests: read & write`, and `Issues: read &
   write`. The Issues permission covers issue/PR summary comments and comment reactions; Metadata
   is provided automatically.
6. Subscribe to the `Issue comment` event. The current implementation is mention-triggered and
   ignores other webhook event types.
7. Create → note the **App ID** → `GITHUB_APP_ID`.
8. Generate a private key → save the `.pem` → `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`.
9. Install the App on the repos you want reviewed (App page → Install App). Record the immutable
   numeric installation and repository IDs from GitHub's API or delivery metadata, then set
   `ALLOWED_GITHUB_INSTALLATION_IDS` and `ALLOWED_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_IDS` before enabling reviews.

### 2. Create the OAuth App (dashboard login)

1. Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App.
2. Homepage URL: `PUBLIC_URL`. Authorization callback URL:
   `https://<host>/auth/github/callback`.
3. Note **Client ID** → `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, generate **Client secret** →
   `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### 3. Configure + run

```bash
SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)   # 32+ random bytes
```

Fill `.env` (all names in `.env.example`), then run `mise exec -- make run-local`. Set
`ADMIN_GITHUB_IDS` to one or more trusted numeric GitHub user IDs **before** starting the service;
there is no first-user administrator bootstrap. Add optional review-only IDs with
`REVIEWER_GITHUB_IDS`. Every requester, including an administrator, must log into the dashboard once
with GitHub before the bot will review their PR, and every request must match both target allowlists.
Do not set `ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGINS`: a non-empty legacy login allowlist is rejected at startup. Add
organization-authorized gateway keys at `/admin/keys`. If the GitHub App login differs from the default,
set `BOT_USERNAME` to its mentionable login without a leading `@`.

### 4. Try it

Open a PR on an installed repo, comment `@samik-bot review please`, expect a 👀 reaction,
then a summary comment with a Mermaid sequence diagram followed by inline findings. Unregistered
commenters get a register-here reply.

| `PI_BIN` | for the `pi` engine | `pi` | Must name a `pi` executable; an absolute path must be inside the pi runtime directory |
| `PI_RUNTIME_DIR` | for the `pi` engine | — | Absolute trusted runtime root holding `bin/pi`, `bin/node`, and the pi package files |
| `BUBBLEWRAP_BIN` | yes | — | Bubblewrap executable path or command resolving to a trusted executable |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | Service log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` |

GitHub ID lists accept positive decimal IDs separated by commas (whitespace is allowed); duplicates
and login names are rejected. Obtain the numeric `id` values from GitHub API responses or webhook
delivery metadata, not from a mutable login or GraphQL node ID. A non-empty `ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGINS`
value is rejected as unsafe.

Every review runs under a mandatory Bubblewrap boundary. At review time, the runner requires a
trusted runtime directory with no symlinked, group-writable, or world-writable entries, and a trusted
non-symlink Bubblewrap executable. It bind-mounts the runtime and PR checkout read-only; it never
falls back to executing the reviewer engine directly when that boundary cannot be established.

Gateway API keys are intentionally entered by an authenticated administrator at `/admin/keys`, not via
an environment variable. The database stores them encrypted, but the database and `SESSION_SECRET`
must be retained together; replacing the secret makes existing stored keys unreadable.

## Deployment and operations

Read [deployment and operations](docs/operations.md) before exposing the webhook. It covers HTTPS,
secret handling, persistent SQLite storage, supported OpenCode 2 beta runtime expectations, key-pool
governance, backups, and the single-replica deployment constraint.

## API (dashboard)

All JSON, session cookie `samik_session`:

- `GET /api/me` → `{id, login, avatar_url, is_admin}`
- `GET /api/reviews` → last 50 `[{id, repo_full, pr_number, head_sha, requester_login, status, model, summary_md, error, summary_comment_id, created_at, findings_count}]`
- `GET /api/reviews/{id}` → `{review, findings: [{path, line, side, severity, body, posted_comment_id}]}`
- Admin: `GET/POST /api/admin/keys`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/keys/{id}` (`{disabled}`),
  `GET/POST /api/admin/settings` (`{model}`). Keys are never returned unmasked (only `last4`).

## Repo layout

- `cmd/samik-bot/main.go` — wiring: config → App auth → store → key pool → engine → server
- `internal/config` — env parsing; `internal/store` — SQLite + migrations
  (`users`, `sessions`, `zen_keys`, `reviews`, `findings`, `nudges`, `settings`)
- `internal/gh` — App JWT → installation token, REST (PR/files/diff/comments/reactions),
  webhook HMAC, OAuth exchange; `internal/server` — webhook handler, OAuth, admin JSON API, SPA
- `internal/pool` — least-used eligible-key selection + configurable cooldown; `internal/runner` —
  shallow clone + Bubblewrap sandbox + isolated reviewer exec (`opencode2` or pi) + final-message extraction
- `internal/review` — prompt contract, tolerant findings parser, diff→line mapping
- `internal/bot` — engine: fetch → runWithPool (one quota retry) → prepare and post the summary
  publication before inline findings → finish/fail
- `web/` — Vite + React + TS + TanStack Router/Query + shadcn-style UI (see above)

## Verification

- `mise exec -- make check` runs Go formatting verification, `go vet`, Go tests, the frontend
  build, and a production binary build.
- A live review can incur gateway charges (OpenCode Zen or OrcaRouter). Use an authorized funded test key, add it at
  `/admin/keys`, comment `@samik-bot` on a test PR, and watch `/dashboard` go queued →
  running → done (or failed, with the cause on the review detail page).
